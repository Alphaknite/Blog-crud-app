This is a CRUD api example using nextjs and mongoDB cloud. 
You can POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE Users.
Users information {name, email, password}

## Getting Started

First, install node_modules
```bash
npm install
```

Then, setup your mongoDB configuration in a .env file
```
MONGODB_URI=<connection string>
make sure to add the cluster name add the end of the string
```
Finally, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
